    <h1 id="title">Skip The Lines</h1>
    <p id="summary">A web-based solution to help students avoid long lines at the IMA (UW's student gym) and on-campus restaurants while providing
        facility managers data regarding business planning and employee scheduling.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>In INFO 200 (Intellectual Foundations of Informatics), my team and I were tasked with the challenge creating a new information resource. In college, time is definitely money. Most of us are not just students. We can also
        be resident advisers, athletes, musicians, waiter, research assistant, etc. However, the long lines at the Intramural Activities Building and food courts were definitely not helping.
        We decided to tackle this problem space and create a wait-time monitoring system for UW students. </p>

    <h2>Figuring It Out</h2>
    <p>First, we identified our users. On one hand, this website will be serving UW students, faculty, staff, and visitors, using it to check the wait-time. On the other,
        it will also be interacting with IMA and food court managers.
        Next, we conducted interviews with our users about their needs, in which we found: </p>
    <ol>Students
        <li>Being able to avoid places when "rush hours" occurs</li>
        <li>Easy method of checking restaurant and gym hours, restaurant secondary locations, restaurant menus, etc.</li>
        <li>Being efficient about the little time they have.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>Managers
        <li>Identifying the “rush hour” to make staffing adjustments.</li>
        <li>Spread awareness of hours of operation, restaurant secondary locations, etc.</li>
        <li>Identify efficient/inefficient staff teams</li>
        <li>Obtain data in order to plan better hours or more locations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We then created 3 personas based on our findings from talking to users.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>First, we thought about using <s>the number of card swipes per 10 minutes to measure busyness</s>. The majority of UW's restaurants are cashless, and the gym requires
    the users to swipe their student ID to enter, but we quickly crossed that out. Our reasoning being that a convenient store on campus has a high number of car swipes, but that does not necessarily indicate
    that it's busy. Most students would just buy an apple or a bag of chips and leave, so the checkout process is actually very quick compared to a pasta or a Chinese food booth. </p>

    <p>Then, we decided to go with beacons, which is a small-piece of hardware that communicate with smartphones and tablets through Bluetooth technology.</p>

    <p>Restaurant managers would install one beacon at the beginning of the line and another at the end of the line. When a customer enters the line, the first beacon would record his/her
        time. When the customer leaves, the second beacon will record that time. A server in the backend would then calculate the amount of time the customer spends in the line
        by subtracting the two and average it out over 10 customers and provide it to our users on the website. </p>

    <p>At the gym, each machine can have a beacon attached to it. If it detects a smartphone, that means
        it is currently being occupied.</p>

    <p>We believed that beacons would be the best solution because of their following qualities:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Low cost (around $10-$12), which means it is easy to scale for a public university with a limited budget.</li>
        <li>Low maintenance. They take about a minute to install, don't need to be plugged in, weather proof(which is a problem in Seattle),
            and have about a 2 year battery life.</li>
        <li>Does not require the users to perform any task to provide us with data.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We presented our final product as clickable wireframes at the class project fair to our program chairs, professors, teaching assistants, and classmates and received
    many positive reviews! </p>
