        <h3>(In Progress)</h3>

        <p id="summary">A check-in website for my hall council, MARC, when they attend the meetings in order to track attendance. I also use this to teach
            them about web development.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Many of the <b><a href="weijen.me/MARC.html">MARC</a></b> members, mostly freshmen, are thinking about pursuing Computer Science or Informatics at
            the University of Washington. After my great time in INFO 343 (Client-side Web Development),
            especially updating <b><a href="weijen.me/molly.html">Molly's Caribbean</a></b>, I realized how much I enjoyed learning about
            web development. Therefore, I decide to teach what I learned in the class to MARC member and expose them to more coding.
            </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p> We would meet once a week for an hour to work on this website. It is designed to replace the current sign-in system, which is a simple Excel
            worksheet with everyone's name it. The class would attract about 5-10 people per week and I follow a very similar lesson plan as my INFO 343 class.
            So far, we have covered git, command line, HTML, CSS, jQuery as well as other web tools such as FontAwesome, Google Fonts, Coolors, etc.
            I really want my hall council members to walk away with skills that they deem as valuable and relevant, and can also help them in the future
            when they apply for their majors, which was not always the case in the past.
        </p>

        <p>My <b><a href="http://students.washington.edu/weijen03/info343/MARC-sign-in/">website</a></b> has a similar feel to the MARC information site, but
        I allow everyone to design there own so that no two websites will look the same. I just provide the necessary tools and tips they can use to make
        their creativity come alive. </p>

        <p>Current Progress: March 13th 2016 finished introducing DOM and jQuery. </p>
