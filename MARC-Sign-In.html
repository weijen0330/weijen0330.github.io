        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>In the beginning of the school year, when we recruit for hall council members, the Resident Director and the Assistant Resident Director would host information sessions for Mercer residents
            who are interested. However, it is simply too much information for people to retain afterwards, since hall council consists of at least 10 different positions and 3
            hierarchies. In order to access the application, people also have to type in a long URL to do so. Our goal was to have all the information in one place.
