    <p id="summary">Updated the website for a small company based in Seattle that sells honeymoon packages to newlyweds. My team and I cleaned
        up their  HTML and CSS code, made the site mobile friendly, and created two brand new features.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Towards the end of my INFO 343 class (Client-side Web Development), we were asked to turn in a final project. One of my professors ex-students
        reached out to us and told us that his mom was looking for someone to update the website's look and make it mobile friendly. We were excited about project,
        but our customer asked us not to mess with the JavaScript, which we wanted to challenge ourselves for the final project, so we decided to implement
        two new features.</p>

    <h2>Figuring It Out</h2>

    <p>After sitting down face-to-face with our client Chris (representing his mom, Molly), together we were able to identify a list of issues that
        the  <b><a href="http://www.mollyscaribbean.com/">old website</a></b> has.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Molly's photo up at the top are all crammed together.</li>
        <li>The home page (Picture 1) has two background pictures pieced together in the banner area.</li>
        <li>There are an incredible amount of white space on all the pages.</li>
        <li>The footer is awkwardly large on all the pages.</li>
        <li>The contact/email form (Picture 5) is very outdated. It feels like a phishing site.</li>
        <li>Molly meets most of her clients at wedding shows, which are hidden to the side in the "Upcoming Seattle Events"
        and "Upcoming Portland Events" sections.</li>
    </ol>

    </div>

    <p>As for the mobile side, the words just scale very chaotically. Some of them are too big and some of them are small,
    making it very hard on the eyes when checking out the website on a smartphone.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>Here is the <b><a href="http://students.washington.edu/nordale1/info343/343FP/CSdeliverable/homepage.html">new website!</a></b>
        The first task on our to-do list was to clean up the code. I noticed that the person
        who developed the original website would specified the CSS style in the HTML file with a style tag, and even
        if an element is repeatedly being used, such as the boxes in the FAQ section,
        he/she would type out the same style for all of them, producing lots of redundancy. To resolve this issue, I simply
        created a CSS file to house all the style rules. Then, my team and I were able address each of issues
        we learned from our client one by one. Here how we solved them respectively:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We spaced out the logos out so they are not all jammed in the middle of the page and easier to look at.</li>
        <li>We took just one of the photos and blew it up to fit the entire page.</li>
        <li>We used the background picture to cover the entire page and place all the content in a dark overlay.</li>
        <li>We took away the footer to make the entire page more cohesive.</li>
        <li>Our client told us that most people actually don't even used the "Request A Quote" function in the banner area. They usually
        just emailed her for business inquiries. We took this into consideration and eliminated the email page entirely and switched to
        a jQuery modal plugin instead. It pops up when customers press "Email Molly", and it allows the customers to quickly return to the main
        site when they are finished by clicking the "x" button instead of the back button.
            This new flow makes sense to us since "Email Molly" is so frequently used.</li>
        <li>Since our client meets the majority of her customers at wedding shows, we decided to move those dates to the top of the page where they
        can be prominently displayed rather than hidden to the side, as well as her mission statement.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div id="newWeb">
        <a href="http://students.washington.edu/nordale1/info343/343FP/CSdeliverable/homepage.html">
            <img src="img/Molly/New/Website/NewMollyWeb-Home.png" alt="New Molly's Caribbean Website- Home">
        </a>
        <a href="http://students.washington.edu/nordale1/info343/343FP/CSdeliverable/faq.html">
            <img src="img/Molly/New/Website/NewMollyWeb-FAQ.png" alt="New Molly's Caribbean Website- FAQ">
        </a>
        <img src="img/Molly/New/Website/NewMollyWeb-Email.png" alt="New Molly's Caribbean Website- Email">
    </div>

        <p>For mobile, we simply added more CSS rules so that everything scales down nicely. We also wanted to focus on simplicity, which was why
        we took away most of the pictures on the homepage and left only important information: her logos, "Emailing Molly", mission statement, and wedding show dates. </p>
    <div id="newMob" class="mobile">
        <img src="img/Molly/New/Mobile/NewMollyMobile-Home.png" alt="New Molly's Caribbean Mobile - Home">
        <img src="img/Molly/New/Mobile/NewMollyMobile-FAQ.png" alt="New Molly's Caribbean Mobile - FAQ">
        <img src="img/Molly/New/Mobile/NewMollyMobile-Email.png" alt="New Molly's Caribbean Mobile - Email">
    </div>

    <p>Our deliverable for Chris and Molly pretty much stopped here. They used WordPress to host this site so if we did anything with JavaScript
    it would likely be incompatible. However, we wanted to get creative, so we added two new features to the website. Just for fun. </p>

    <p>I was in charge of implementing the first feature, which is a face-tracking video booth I called <b><a href="https://students.washington.edu/nordale1/info343/343FP/paradise.html">
        "Picture Yourself In Paradise."</a></b> I wanted the customers to experience a little piece of the Caribbean from the comfort of sitting in front of their computers.
        I worked with PhotoShop to manipulate the bikini photo slightly, HTML's camera and video element, JavaScript, as well as an open-source face-tracking library called <b><a href="https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr">headtrackr</a></b>
        that I found online. (and yes! That's my face in the photo! Not my body though...)</p>

    <p>The second one I only assisted, but it is a <b><a href="http://students.washington.edu/nordale1/info343/343FP/CSdeliverable/map.html">
        weather map</a></b> of the exotic countries that Molly sends her customers to in the Caribbean. We got the idea
        because Chris told us that the weather in the Caribbean varies greatly, and the customers definitely would not want to be rained on during
        their honeymoon.</p>

    <p>Our clients Molly and Chris really like the final product, as well as the extra features that we created for fun. </p>
