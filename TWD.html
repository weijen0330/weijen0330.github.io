    <h1 id="title">The Walking Dead Fansite</h1>

    <p id="summary">A website for the popular TV show from AMC that connects with the fans through three compelling
        applets that is unique to the show and supports all its content.</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>In my INFO 330 class (User Experience and Information Architecture), we were asked to imagine that we were hired by
        <b><a href="http://www.buddytv.com/">BuddyTV</a></b>, a TV listing site to follow shows, to build a fansite of our choice.
        We decided to go with <b><a href="http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead">The Walking Dead</a></b> and
        we have to create three applets that would really capture the show and engage with the fans.</p>

    <h2>Figuring It Out</h2>
    <p>My partner and I started the project by constructing some paper prototypes. We did not want to start
        working on the computer right away because we knew that staring at the screen for too long could stimulate the
        brain too much and hinder our creativity. Plus, it is easier to scratch ideas away on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a brainstorming session, we decided on these three features:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Character statistics over the seasons.</li>
        <li>Comparing the TV and the comic world, showing the similarities and the differences between the two.</li>
        <s><li>A zombie simulator. The user will become a zombie and its goal is to kill the cast members.</li></s>
    </ol>
    <p>However, after presenting to our professor and classmates, we learned that our third feature is too complicated for
    the scope of this project. People love the game idea, but there are just so many details we have to consider in order to make
    this viable, we crossed that out eventually. <u>We decided to do a "Caption This" contest instead.</u> Below are our paper prototypes as well
    2 use cases with the last one being an edge case. </p>

    </div>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>Here is our "deadly" (Ha! Get it?) <b><a href="http://vvwcii.axshare.com/#p=home">final product as
        clickable prototypes</a></b>!</p>
    <p>After getting past the home page (Picture 1), the first feature, <b><a href="http://vvwcii.axshare.com/#p=characters">Characters</a></b>, displays the statistics of each
        protagonist in the show. After clicking on a character, a details page would show up with information such
        as the character's kill count, favorite gun, relationships with other characters, etc. The "x" button on the
        upper right hand corner will take the users back to the group shot. This would only display
        characters and stats from the current season, but after the show ends, it will have the ability to display
        characters throughout the entire series organized by seasons.</p>
    <p>For the prototype, only Rick Grimes is clickable. </p>

    </div>

    <p>The second feature is called <b><a href="http://vvwcii.axshare.com/#p=tv_vs_comics_-_pick_timeline">TV vs Comics</a></b>.
        We wanted to create a comparison feature because we knew that The Walking Dead
        is a multi-platform universe. It started out from the comic world, extends to television, and now it also has several
        video games. We decided to only work with the TV and the comics because the video games
        do not really draw enough parallels.
    </p>
    <p>When the TV vs. Comics tab is clicked, this page would pop up and the users can decide how they want to organize the scenes, which
    depends on what platform they are most familiar with.</p>
    <div>
        <a href="http://vvwcii.axshare.com/#p=tv_vs_comics_-_pick_timeline">
            <img src="img/TWD/TWD-Choice.png" alt="The Walking Dead Fansite - TV vs. Comics ">
        </a>
    </div>
    <p>The TV platform will display the scenes by seasons and the comic platform will display the scenes by volumes. If the users have yet
    to see the episode or read the volume and want to avoid spoilers, there is a spoilers filter up top for them.</p>
    <div>
        <a href="http://vvwcii.axshare.com/#p=tv_vs_comics_-_seasons">
            <img src="img/TWD/TWD-Season.png" alt="The Walking Dead Fansite - Order By Seasons">

            <img src="img/TWD/TWD-Volume.png" alt="The Walking Dead Fansite - Order By Volume">
        </a>
    </div>
    <p>After the users have selected a scene, the toggle switch will allow them to navigate through the following three screens.
        They can watch the TV clip/read the comic strip again, compare it with the the other platform,
        and have them displayed side-by-side by clicking "Both". The interface will also provide them with some context to
        remind them about the scene.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, our site will have the <b><a href="http://vvwcii.axshare.com/#p=caption_this">"Caption This"</a></b> contest.
        We wanted something with a competitive element as well as user-generated content. Each week, we will post a scene from the show
        and the users will be able to use their creativity to generate and post the funniest caption they can think of.
        Other users will be able to upvote or downvote a caption and the one with the highest vote will win a prize!
